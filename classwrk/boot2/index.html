    <p>The City of New York, usually referred to as either New York City (NYC) or simply New York (NY), is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2018 population of 8,398,748 distributed over a land area of about 302.6 square miles (784 km2), New York is also the most densely populated major city in the United States.[10] Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, the largest metropolitan area in the world by urban landmass[11] and one of the world's most populous megacities,[12][13] with an estimated 19,979,477 people in its 2018 Metropolitan Statistical Area and 22,679,948 residents in its Combined Statistical Area.[3][4] A global power city,[14] New York City has been described as the cultural,[15][16][17][18][19] financial,[20][21] and media capital of the world,[22][23] and exerts a significant impact upon commerce,[21] entertainment, research, technology, education, politics, tourism, art, fashion, and sports. The city's fast pace[24][25][26] has inspired the term New York minute.[27] Home to the headquarters of the United Nations,[28] New York is an important center for international diplomacy.[29][30]
<br><br>
Situated on one of the world's largest natural harbors, New York City consists of five boroughs, each of which is a separate county of the State of New York.[33] The five boroughs – Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, The Bronx, and Staten Island – were consolidated into a single city in 1898.[34] The city and its metropolitan area constitute the premier gateway for legal immigration to the United States.[35] As many as 800 languages are spoken in New York,[36][37][38] making it the most linguistically diverse city in the world.[37][39][40] New York City is home to more than 3.2 million residents born outside the United States,[41] the largest foreign-born population of any city in the world.[42] As of 2019, the New York metropolitan area is estimated to produce a gross metropolitan product (GMP) of US$1.9 trillion.[8] If greater New York City were a sovereign state, it would have the 12th highest GDP in the world.[43] New York is home to the highest number of billionaires of any city in the world.[44]
<br><br>
New York City traces its origins to a trading post founded by colonists from the Dutch Republic in 1624 on Lower Manhattan; the post was named New Amsterdam in 1626.[45] The city and its surroundings came under English control in 1664[45] and were renamed New York after King Charles II of England granted the lands to his brother, the Duke of York.[46] New York was the capital of the United States from 1785 until 1790,[47] and has been the largest US city since 1790.[48] The Statue of Liberty greeted millions of immigrants as they came to the U.S. by ship in the late 19th and early 20th centuries[49] and is an international symbol of the U.S. and its ideals of liberty and peace.[50] In the 21st century, New York has emerged as a global node of creativity and entrepreneurship,[51] social tolerance,[52] and environmental sustainability,[53][54] and as a symbol of freedom and cultural diversity.[55] In 2019, New York was voted the greatest city in the world per a survey of over 30,000 people from 48 cities worldwide, citing its cultural diversity.

Many districts and landmarks in New York City are well known, including three of the world's ten most visited tourist attractions in 2013;[56] a record 62.8 million tourists visited in 2017.[57] Several sources have ranked New York the most photographed city in the world.[58][59] Times Square, iconic as the world's "heart"[60] and "crossroads",[61] is the brightly illuminated hub of the Broadway Theater District,[62] one of the world's busiest pedestrian intersections,[63][64] and a major center of the world's entertainment industry.[65] The names of many of the city's landmarks, skyscrapers,[66] and parks are known internationally. Manhattan's real estate market is among the most expensive in the world.[67][68] New York is home to the largest ethnic Chinese population outside of Asia,[69][70] with multiple distinct Chinatowns across the city.[71][72][73] Providing continuous 24/7 service,[74] the New York City Subway is the largest single-operator rapid transit system worldwide, with 472 rail stations. The city has over 120 colleges and universities, including Columbia University, New York University, and Rockefeller University, ranked among the top universities in the world.[78][79] Anchored by Wall Street in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan, New York has been called both the most economically powerful city and world's leading financial center,[21][80][81][82] and is home to the world's two largest stock exchanges by total market capitalization, the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ.</p>

<h2 id='empire'>Empire State Building</h2>
<img src="images/empire.jpg" alt="Empire State Building" class="img1" title="Empire State Building">
<p>The Empire State Building is a 102-story[c] Art Deco skyscraper in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. It was designed by Shreve, Lamb & Harmon and completed in 1931. The building has a roof height of 1,250 feet (380 m) and stands a total of 1,454 feet (443.2 m) tall, including its antenna. Its name is derived from "Empire State", the nickname of New York, which is of unknown origin. The Empire State Building stood as the world's tallest building for nearly 40 years until the completion of the World Trade Center's North Tower in Lower Manhattan in late-1970. Following the September 11 attacks in 2001, it was again the tallest building in New York City until the new One World Trade Center surpassed it while under construction in April 2012. As of 2019, the building is the seventh-tallest building in New York City, the sixth-tallest completed skyscraper in the United States, and the 45th-tallest in the world. It is also the sixth-tallest freestanding structure in the Americas.
<br><br>
The site of the Empire State Building, located in Midtown South on the west side of Fifth Avenue between West 33rd and 34th Streets, was originally part of an early 18th-century farm, then became the site of the Waldorf–Astoria Hotel in 1893.[15] In 1929, Empire State Inc. acquired the site and devised plans for a skyscraper there. The design for the Empire State Building was changed fifteen times until it was ensured to be the world's tallest building. Construction started on March 17, 1930, and the building opened thirteen and a half months afterward on May 1, 1931. Despite the publicity surrounding the building's construction, its owners failed to make a profit until the early 1950s. However, since its opening, the building's Art Deco architecture and open-air observation deck has made it a popular attraction, with around 4 million tourists from around the world visiting the building's 86th and 102nd floor observatories every year.[16]
<br><br>
The building stands within a mile of other major Midtown tourist attractions including Grand Central Terminal, Pennsylvania Station, Madison Square Garden, Koreatown, and Macy's Herald Square.
<br><br>
The Empire State Building is an American cultural icon and has been featured in more than 250 TV shows and movies since the film King Kong was released in 1933. A symbol of New York City, the tower has been named as one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World by the American Society of Civil Engineers. The Empire State Building and its ground-floor interior have been designated as a city landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, and were confirmed as such by the New York City Board of Estimate. It was also designated a National Historic Landmark in 1986, and was ranked number one on the American Institute of Architects' List of America's Favorite Architecture in 2007.</p>

<p>The extraordinary centerpiece of Hudson Yards is its spiral staircase, a soaring new landmark meant to be climbed. This interactive artwork was imagined by Thomas Heatherwick and Heatherwick Studio as a focal point where people can enjoy new perspectives of the city and one another from different heights, angles and vantage points.
<br><br>
Comprised of 154 intricately interconnecting flights of stairs -- almost 2,500 individual steps and 80 landings -- the vertical climb offers remarkable views of the city, the river and beyond.</p>

<h2 id='oculus'>The Oculus</h2>

<p>World Trade Center is a terminal station on the PATH system. It is located in the World Trade Center complex, within the Financial District neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City. It is served by the Newark–World Trade Center line on weekdays and holiday weekends, as well as by the Hoboken–World Trade Center line on weekdays, and is the eastern terminus of both.
<br><br>
The World Trade Center station is located near the site of the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad (H&M)'s Hudson Terminal, which opened on July 19, 1909. In 1961, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey bought the bankrupt H&M system, rebranded it as PATH, and redeveloped Hudson Terminal as part of the World Trade Center. As part of the construction of the World Trade Center, Hudson Terminal was torn down, replaced with the World Trade Center station, and re-opened on July 6, 1971. Following the September 11, 2001 attacks, a temporary station opened in 2003 while the World Trade Center complex was being rebuilt. Work on a permanent station building commenced in 2008. The main station house, the Oculus, opened on March 3, 2016, and the terminal was renamed the World Trade Center Transportation Hub, or "World Trade Center" for short.
<br><br>
The World Trade Center station has five tracks (three for Hoboken-bound trains, two for Newark-bound trains) and four platforms in the middle of a turning loop. Trains from New Jersey use the loop to turn around and head back to New Jersey. The platforms are located four floors below ground level. The floor immediately above the platforms is occupied by the station's fare mezzanine. The New York City Subway's WTC Cortlandt station is adjacent to and above the mezzanine.
<br><br>
The $4 billion Oculus station house, designed by Santiago Calatrava, consists of white ribs that interlock high above the ground. The interior of the station house contains two underground floors, which house part of the Westfield World Trade Center mall. The transportation hub connects the various modes of transportation in Lower Manhattan, from the Fulton Center in the east to the Battery Park City Ferry Terminal in the west, through the station house. The hub contains connections to various New York City Subway stations, including Chambers Street–World Trade Center/Park Place/Cortlandt Street on the 2, ​3​, A, ​C, ​E​, ​N, ​R, and ​W trains and WTC Cortlandt on the 1 train. It is the fifth-busiest transportation hub in the New York metropolitan area.
<br><br>
The Westfield World Trade Center mall is also within the Oculus building. The new station has received mixed reviews: although the hub has been praised for its design, it has also been criticized for its high costs and extended delays.</p>
